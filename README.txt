KortsiLayer
This script is going to be a comprehensive overview of what I have learned
in OPT246, Optical Interference Coatings, at University of Rochester in
Rochester, NY. By the end of this project, my goal is to have a GUI 
interface where you can enter the data for a coatings stack/film, and you 
are able to get comprehensive data about said stack/film. In short, the 
goal is to essentially create a coatings software. I have adopted the name
"Kortsilayer" to mimic Optilayer. This is because my code will mimic
Optilayer in principle purpose, not necessarily function (this
clarification is being made to avoid confusion.
