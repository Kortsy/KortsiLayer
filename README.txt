This script is going to be a comprehensive overview of what I have learned
in OPT246, Optical Interference Coatings, at University of Rochester in
Rochester, NY. By the end of this project, my goal is to have a GUI 
interface where you can enter the data for a coatings stack/film, and you 
are able to get comprehensive data about said stack/film. In short, the 
goal is to essentially create a watered down (or at least I assume I will
not be creating a high-function coating design software)version of 
OptiLayer.

As it stands at the time I am beginning this project (10/15/21), I have
yet to have the opportunity to use Optilayer in my Interference Coatings
class. But, with that being said, I am aware that, in order to solve for
the system info we seek, OptiLayer uses the Characteristic Matrix. As
such, I will also be calculating using the characteristic matric.
